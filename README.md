Text based CLI tools are wonderful. They are fast, lightweight, and universally accessible. Best of all - building them in modern JavaScript is a delightful experience.

After a quick overview of the history of CLI tools and how they really work, you will be introduced to the Node.js ecosystem for building CLI tools. We will then take a deeper look at Ink v2 - a super awesome library that allows us to use React and Flexbox to create complex, dynamic, and interactive command-line interfaces.

## Usage

Use `npm start` to spin up a local dev server for the slides. You have to be connected to the Internet for the emojis to load. :)

There are 2 demos you can fire up with `npm run counter` and `npm run wiki`.

## Stuff Used

Slides made with the amazing [`mdx-deck`](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck). Colorful emojis powered by [`react-emoji-render`](https://github.com/tommoor/react-emoji-render), because the way emojis get rendered is so inconsistent across platforms, and I don't want to discriminate any computers. :D

Fonts are [Fira Sans](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) and [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). I can't live without ligatures nowadays.
